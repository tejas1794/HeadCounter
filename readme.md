# HeadCounter

HeadCounter is our project for Crowd Counting. The application allows users to upload an image and get the number of people in the image. The distribution of components is described below:

- Dataset: This folder contains part of the dataset, except for images because of GitHub's limited storage requirements
- Modelling: This folder contains jupyter notebook where we go through the process of creating the model. Excludes the model.h5 file because of storage constraints
- Flask App: This folder contains logic for the flask app, excludes model file because of storage constraints.
- Documentation: Contains Project report describing the project and link to the demonstration video

The live website is currently hosted on https://headcounter.azurewebsites.net/
